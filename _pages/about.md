I am a PhD Student in K-12 Educational Leadership and Policy Studies in the Department of Leadership, Policy & Organizations at Peabody College, Vanderbilt University. Currently, I work as a graduate research assistant at the [Tennessee Education Research Alliance (TERA)](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tera/index.php), a research-practice partnership between Peabody College and the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE).

My research uses large-scale administrative data from Tennessee and New Mexico to study teacher effectiveness and teacher evaluation policy, with specific focus on the technical properties of commonly-used teacher evaluation measures. My dissertation examines the extent to which classroom observation scores capture the impacts of teachers on their students' K-12, post-secondary, and labor market outcomes. 

Prior to attending Vanderbilt, I earned a B.A. in English and political science from the University of Notre Dame.
