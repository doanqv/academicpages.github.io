**Michigan Radio's State of Opportunity**

In 2017, I had the opportunity to contribute to a Michigan Radio State of Opportunity project entitled "[We Live Here"](http://stateofopportunity.michiganradio.org/post/we-live-here-neighborhood-school-brink-closure), which explores the history and future of neighborhood schools in Detroit. Links to my data visualization work are provided below:
